        The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors,
        software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and
        systems over the Internet.</p>

    <h2>Defining IoT</h2>
    <p>The definition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of things</a> has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time
        analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems,
        wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all
        contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with
        products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting
        fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more
        common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and
        smart speakers. IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.</p>

    <p> There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy
        and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun including
        the development of international standards.</p>
